In this repo, I have included all of the code to my personal hobby website www.youtubechannelratings.com.
Feel free to browse the code if you are wondering about how I implemented my website. The majority of my code
is written in PHP, HTML, Javascript, and MySQL. I will not describe exactly how my website works because there
are thousandsof lines of code, but I will give a brief summary.

1) Users can, of course, watch videos based on which category of videos they wish to browse through. There are over 100
   listed on my website.

2) Users post videos by category using Submit Video page or by navigating to the specific category page and then
   submitting the video.
   
3) When the videos are submitted into the category, these video links are saved in my database and are later recalled when
   the page loads.
   
4) Users can also view rated YouTube channels based on category if they do not know what to watch but know what type of
   videos interest them. They can look at the channels rating and a description of each channel.
   
-In the near future I plan to have a blogging software implemented into my website so that people can create threads and 
 discussions on what they would like. I would like to add a community-type of feeling to my website.
